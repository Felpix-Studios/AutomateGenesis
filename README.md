Is your shitty school off cause of Coronavirus? Does your shitty school *also* use Genesis for grading and attendance? If so this patchwork-bodged in 20 minutes webscraper is for you.

1. Get Node.Js https://nodejs.org/en/ 
2. Put the code in whatever directory, go to CMD, go to said directory and type 
```shell
npm install
```
3. Now you're working! Now just run the file.
```shell
node app.js insertyouremail@email.com insertyourpassword
```
4. Sit back, relax, and do your damn distance learning.
